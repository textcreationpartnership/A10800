            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And therefore, vpon bended knees lifteth vp the hands for mercy.

In the prayer the Prophet ſheweth his faith and hope. Faith, in that ſtriuing againſt deſpaire, he putteth vp his ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and complaint, Generally, expreſsing his diſtreſſed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. <hi>Out of the deep places I haue called vpon thee O Lord:</hi> particularly, deſiring releaſe of puniſhmen <hi>Lord heare my voice.</hi> And diſcharge of his ſinne. <hi>Let thing eares attend to the voice of my prayers,</hi> (ſuiters for pardon and mercy,) for ſo the word ſignifieth.

<hi>But mercy is with thee.</hi> Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated by the end: that thou maieſt be feared. This for his faith, for his hope, beeing perſwaded that God will be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull: he first layeth it downe abſolutely, I haue waited on the Lord. And this is enlarged from the efficient, that it is not a formall proteſtation of the tongue, but a ſincere reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the heart. <hi>My ſoule hath waited,</hi> from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect. <hi>I haue truſted in thy word,</hi> that is, in the ſweete pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of pardon of ſinnes from the conſtancie and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance thereof, comparatiuely expreſſed in a liuely picture, and excelling in a higher degree, that whereunto it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, <hi>More then the morning watch watcheth for the morning.</hi> Hitherto the prayer.

                     <p>Of the Authour of this redemption, we haue heard. Now the ſubiect redeemed, is Iſrael; that is the number of the faithfull, to whom this benefit doth belong.</p>
                     <p>Hereof it neceſſarily followeth, that Chriſt hath payed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> his Father, the price for the ſinnes of man.

                     <p>Firſt, for whom the ſonne of God did not pray, for them he did not offer himſelfe.

                     <p>Secondly, if it be true that he payed the ranſome, and dyed for all indifferently, and effectually; then ſhould not his death be beneficiall to them, for whom he dyed. For it doth not profit the reprobate, who ſhall be puniſhed with eternall perdition, from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power. 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 9. whoſe doome is pronounced by Chriſt: Depart from me yee curſed into euerlaſting fire, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared

Then hereof wil follow many dangerous conſequents, which doe ouerthrow the groundes of Chriſtian religion.

                     <p>Secondly, If God ſhould puniſh man, and yet pardon his ſinne; this were contrary both to his iuſtice and his mercy: to his iuſtice, for he hath accepted of the ſatisfaction made by Chriſt, who hath payed the debt, and acquited vs, when he bare our ſinnes vpon the tree; and we were healed by his woundes. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24. and therefore aſſured that he would remember our offences no more. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 18. 22.

<hi>Eſay</hi> 53. 5.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, in the time of <hi>Zedekiah</hi> it diſpleaſed God, that when according to the couenant made, the Iews had ſet free their ſeruants, they repented of that deede, and compelled them to returne, and held them in ſubiection; and therefore threatned a iudgement,
<hi>Ierem.</hi> 34. 11. 17.

Nothing leſſe; and therefore when he offereth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe of ſinnes, he vſeth ſuch wordes as doe include both the one and the other; as to blot them out, to waſh them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 51. 2. to remoue them ſo farre out of his ſight as the Eaſt is from the Weſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 12. to caſt them behinde his backe, <hi>Eſay</hi> 38. 17. not to impute or lay them to our charge,
