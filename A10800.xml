            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And the reaÅ¿on thereof is that irreuocable decree of God, when he forbad to eate of the fruite of the tree of knowledge of good and euill, vnder that penalty, What day Å¿oeuer thou eate thereof, thou Å¿halt die, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. for euen then he was in a Å¿ort <note n="x" place="margin">Mortuus eÅ¿t Adam peccans. r.

Of the beginnings of death; for euen then, Å¿o Å¿oone as he had offended, his body was depriued of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, and he begun by little and little, and by degrees, to be corrupted, and returne to earth, whereof he was made.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If God Å¿hould puniÅ¿h man, and yet pardon his Å¿inne; this were contrary both to his iuÅ¿tice and his mercy: to his iuÅ¿tice, for he hath accepted of the Å¿atisfaction made by ChriÅ¿t, who hath payed the debt, and acquited vs, when he bare our Å¿innes vpon the tree; and we were healed by his woundes. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24. and therefore aÅ¿Å¿ured that he would remember our offences no more. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 18. 22.

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:12329:53"/> imputed vnto vs, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20. Wherefore to reÅ¿olue vs, that this his mercy is no halfe mercy, Å¿peaking of our pardon and reconciliation, he vÅ¿eth words of the plurall number, as For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneÅ¿Å¿es, <note n="y" place="margin">Deus condona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionum. Vide Wolphium in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um locum.</note>

<hi>Luc.</hi> 1. 78. And that our aÅ¿Å¿urance might be the Å¿tronger, he doth in a Å¿ort open vnto vs the treaÅ¿ures of his fauor, that where Å¿inne abounded, there grace Å¿uperabounded,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 20. and therefore the Prophet layeth out the Å¿euerall parts of our redemption; where he Å¿aith not onely that ChriÅ¿t was wounded for our Å¿innes, and broken for our tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ions, but addeth alÅ¿o, that the chaÅ¿tiÅ¿ement of our peace was laid vpon him,
<hi>EÅ¿ay</hi> 53. 5.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, in the time of <hi>Zedekiah</hi> it diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ed God, that when according to the couenant made, the Iews had Å¿et free their Å¿eruants, they repented of that deede, and compelled them to returne, and held them in Å¿ubiection; and therefore threatned a iudgement,
<hi>Ierem.</hi> 34. 11. 17. And then Å¿hall we thinke that there is vnrighteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e with God, and that he will promiÅ¿e pardon of Å¿innes, and liberty vnto the faithfull, and yet impoÅ¿e vpon them puniÅ¿hment as a new enthrall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Nothing leÅ¿Å¿e; and therefore when he offereth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneÅ¿Å¿e of Å¿innes, he vÅ¿eth Å¿uch wordes as doe include both the one and the other; as to blot them out, to waÅ¿h them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, <hi>PÅ¿a.</hi> 51. 2. to remoue them Å¿o farre out of his Å¿ight as the EaÅ¿t is from the WeÅ¿t, <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 103. 12. to caÅ¿t them behinde his backe, <hi>EÅ¿ay</hi> 38. 17. not to impute or lay them to our charge,
<hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 32. 2. In which forme of Å¿peech is a Å¿imilitude borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from creditors, who cannot comence Å¿uite or enter action againÅ¿t their debtors, if the Obligation be once cancelled, and the debt Å¿atisfied by whomÅ¿oeuer. But ChriÅ¿t hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the way the hand-writing that was againÅ¿t vs, <hi>ColoÅ¿Å¿.</hi> 2. 14. we therefore haue obtained a
<hi>quietus eÅ¿t,</hi> and are freed.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, when we are commaunded to forgiue one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther iniuries offered, it is vrged by this reaÅ¿on: As God hath forgiuen vs, <hi>ColoÅ¿.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4. 32. and Å¿o in the parable, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 23. 35. Now this forgiuenes muÅ¿t not be with a retention

Therefore much more is perfite in God, whoÅ¿e forgiuenes is the rule of ours; ours not an equality, but animitation of his.

                     <p>FirÅ¿t, euery man doth either beleeue or not beleeue. He that beleeueth and continueth in faith, is freed from the wrath of God, and the curÅ¿e, and doth not come into iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but hath euerlaÅ¿ting life: he that beleeueth not, the wrath of God abideth vpon him. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 36. There be then no newtrals, who may in Purgatory be cleanÅ¿ed from thoÅ¿e Å¿innes, whereof in this life, they haue not obtayned pardon.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the puniÅ¿hment of Å¿inne belongeth as well to the body, as the Å¿oule: but Purgatory fire is no puniÅ¿hment for the body, for that reÅ¿teth in the graue. Therefore, there can be no Purgatory after death, before the laÅ¿t day, when the Å¿oule and body Å¿hall be conioyned together, and both either eternally tormented, or eternally bleÅ¿Å¿ed.</p>
